Repository of team TripleM for NLP @ UL FRI. Project 3:Cross-lingual sense disambiguation

## Instructions
Project 3: Cross-lingual sense disambiguation

Students will jointly work on dataset preparation and then use multilingual models for English and Slovene corpora. There exists an English variant of a task -  the word-in-context (WiC) SuperGLUE task. The results will be compared with a Slovene-only and multilingual model.


The UL FRI are expected to semi-automatically prepare corpus and perform analyses on it. A group can select random words, check their collocations and try to detect different contexts automatically. After that examples will need to be manually checked and corrected. Corpus will also need to be published to Clarin.si repository.


TBA: More precise timplan will be presented for this task as it is two-fold: (a) dataset preparation, and (b) analyses.
